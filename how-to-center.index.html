    <h5>Let's say that you already know how to center an element; like a paragraph, or a title. You might feel tempted to try and fix an image the exact same way. You could do it that way, if you don't mind having text along with the image. But, what if you only wanted the image to be positioned in the center? Then what?</h5>
    <br>
      <p>There are a couple of ways of doing it, but only two will be shown here. The first to be demostrated will be where the image will be wraped in another element like; a <span>&ltdiv&gt &lt/div&gt</span> in order to tell it to center the image.</p>
      <div><span>div.box {</span><br>
      <span>text-align: center;</span><br>
      <span>}</span><br></div>
      
      <p>The sencond example that will be shown here, will be: making the image a block level element, in order to position the image however you want it... in this case, we want the image to be centered. We will be using the following code to display it.</p>
      
      <div><span>img{</span><br>
           <span>display: block;</span><br>
    	   <span>margin: 0 auto;</span><br>
    	   <span></span>}<br></div>
      
      <p>REMEMBER: the margin can be display in either 4 or a single value, which will be represented in a counter-clockwise, starting from top.</p>
